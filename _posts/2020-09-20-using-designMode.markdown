`document.desingMode` property has two valid values - "on" and "off".   
By default, It will be "off" value set to it.  	
By setting	`document.designMode = "on"`, we can start edit any content in current HTML Document.   

Now, go to your favourite website, and hit console by pressing F12, and write	
`document.desingMode = "on"` and try to edit the website.
